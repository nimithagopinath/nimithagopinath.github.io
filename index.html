									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/dementia-vs-alzheimers-difference-inlineimage.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										The purpose of this project is to use classification techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy and make contributions to the understanding and management of AD. To achieve this, the project focuses on enhancing model discrimination between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients by incorporating additional metrics such as MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) and education level.

The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaboost, and Logistic Regression. These algorithms are trained using the OASIS project MRI images, which serve as valuable data for training the model. The accuracy achieved by the RM model was approximately 86%.

In addition, the project involves the development of an Alzheimer prediction model. This model leverages popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy for efficient and effective modeling. Furthermore, for comprehensive analysis on the dataset, visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and Plotly are utilized for univariate and multivariate analysis.

Overall, this project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy in Alzheimer's disease by utilizing classification techniques, incorporating additional metrics, and employing various machine learning algorithms for modeling and analysis.

										<h2><a href="#">Water Quality Classification:<br />
										ML with K-means & Random Forest</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/waterquality.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										In this project, unsupervised learning techniques were utilized to analyze and classify water samples based on their quality parameters, with the objective of assessing compliance with predefined standards. The first step involved employing K-means clustering to extract informative features from the dataset. These features were then used to train a Random Forest classification model, which could categorize water samples as either positive or negative based on the selected features.

										To ensure the reliability of the classification results, the performance of the model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By considering these metrics, the project aimed to assess the effectiveness of the classification model and validate its ability to accurately classify water samples according to their quality parameters.
										
										Overall, this project involved the application of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to extract meaningful features from water sample data. These features were then utilized to train a Random Forest classifier, enabling the categorization of water samples as positive or negative. The evaluation of the classification model using various metrics ensured the reliability and accuracy of the classification results, ultimately contributing to the assessment of water quality compliance.

										<h2><a href="#">Diabetes Outcome Prediction: <br />
										Linear vs Ridge Regression</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Diabetes Practice Resources Banner.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										In this project, the primary objective was to develop predictive models that could accurately forecast the likelihood of diabetes occurrence and assess the associated risk level. To achieve this, advanced regression techniques were leveraged to analyze the relevant data.

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the models, prominent Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn were utilized for robust data preprocessing tasks. These tasks included handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. By employing these preprocessing techniques, the data was effectively prepared for model training and evaluation.

In order to compare the performance of different regression models, both linear regression and ridge regression models were implemented. The models were evaluated based on their respective Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values, which served as an indicator of prediction accuracy. The comparison revealed that ridge regression demonstrated greater effectiveness in reducing prediction errors, suggesting its superiority in this context.

Overall, this project involved the development of predictive models using advanced regression techniques to accurately forecast the likelihood of diabetes occurrence and assess associated risk levels. The utilization of prominent Python libraries, such as pandas and scikit-learn, facilitated robust data preprocessing tasks. Furthermore, the comparison of linear regression and ridge regression models highlighted the superior performance of ridge regression in minimizing prediction errors.

										<h2><a href="#">Enhancing Gastrointestinal Endoscopy:<br />
										Deep Learning Polyp Segmentation</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/polyp segmentation.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										Deep learning models were developed to accurately detect and segment polyps from colonoscopy images using the UNet architecture. To enhance the performance of the models, transfer learning was incorporated by initializing the encoder part of the UNet with pre-trained weights from a model like ResNet-50. The Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, pandas, and numpy libraries were utilized in the development of these two deep learning models.

To compare the performance of the models and determine the better model for polyp segmentation, various metrics were employed. The dataset used for training the models was obtained from CVC-ClinicDB, an official database used in the training stages of the MICCAI 2015 Sub-Challenge on Automatic Polyp Detection Challenge in Colonoscopy Videos.

The results demonstrated that the UNet model achieved an accuracy of 93%, while the modified UNet model achieved a higher accuracy of 99%. These findings indicate the effectiveness of the developed deep learning models in accurately detecting and segmenting polyps from colonoscopy images.

In summary, this project successfully developed deep learning models using the UNet architecture and incorporated transfer learning to improve polyp detection and segmentation. The models were evaluated using various metrics, and the results showcased the superior performance of the modified UNet model with a remarkable accuracy of 99%.
